Hey there, world!

I'm **thrilled** to be sharing my very first post on this freshly refurbished portfolio site/blog. It's been a while since I last updated my site, dating back to when I started my Computer Science AP degree.

As I am writing this post, I find myself _unsure_ of what exactly will fill these in the future. Probably rants, maybe exciting new tech? Not sure... But I hope you will stick around to find out.

### The Spark of Inspiration

Although I don't consider myself UI designer, I've always enjoyed assembling elements and creating aesthetically pleasing designs with great user experiences.
You might notice that I've incorporated some of my favorite design choices into this new website.
It's a work in progress, and I'm excited to evolve it as my skills grow.

In case you're curious, here are some of the amazing websites that inspired the design of my own little corner of the internet:

- [https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)
- [https://reflect.app/](https://reflect.app/)
- [https://resend.com/](https://resend.com/)

Until next time,  
Dyrhoi
