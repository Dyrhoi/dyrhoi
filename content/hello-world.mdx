Hey there, world!

It's about time I gave my little _portfolio_ a facelift. I don't think I've updated this since I was doing my Computer Science AP degree...

I'm not entirely sure I even need a blog - but I was bored, so I thought why not add one?
Either way I will be using this space to share my thoughts and experiences as I continue my journey as a developer.

I'm not sure how often I'll be posting, maybe this is the only post you will see... who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Inspiration

Although I don't consider myself UI designer, I've always enjoyed assembling elements and creating aesthetically pleasing designs with great user experiences.
I've incorporated some of my favorite design choices into this new website.
It's a work in progress.

In case you're curious, here are some of the amazing websites that inspired the design of my new portfolio:

- [https://linear.app/](https://linear.app/)
- [https://reflect.app/](https://reflect.app/)
- [https://resend.com/](https://resend.com/)

Until next time,  
Dyrhoi
